TODO
===============================================================================

+ model-based tester

+ logging revisited ?
    -> debug related code with higher verbosity levels?

+ rewrite aconds (writes/lambdas as children) to bvconds
    -> first: only for -rwr

+ handling of more general lambdas with parameterized reads
  e.g. lambda j. j && read (a, j)
  -> we need a more general solution for propagating reads over lambdas


===============================================================================
DONE, but not yet committed

+ beta_reduce: hash reduced expressions
