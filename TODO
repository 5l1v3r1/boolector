+ model-based tester

+ LOGGING
    - debug related code with higher verbosity levels?

+ API
  - boolector_type_safe, boolector_really_type_safe
      needed esp. for UF if we want to check e.g. if (f a i) = (g b i),
      where a,b are arrays

+ LEMMAS
  - lemma generation statistics are not correct if we use lambdas
      arbitrary conditions can be instantiated and encoded

+ BFS
  - lambda bfs
      reads are only propagated along parameterized paths

  - merge bfs and lambda bfs

+ READ PROPAGATION
  - statistics e.g., num propagations, time
