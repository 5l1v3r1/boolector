This is a release of Boolector which is an efficient SMT solver for
the quantifier-free theory of bit-vectors in combination with
the quantifier-free extensional theory of arrays.
Boolector can either be used as stand-alone SMT solver or as 
library in a backend. For a documentation of Boolector and its public 
interface see 'doc/html/index.html'.

The directory 'include' contains the header file of Boolector's 
public interface. You can find the compiled library 
in the directory 'lib'. Finally, you can find examples in 'examples'.
