  This is a release of Boolector which is an efficient SMT solver for
  the quantifier-free theory of bit-vectors in combination with
  the quantifier-free extensional theory of arrays.
  Boolector can either be used as stand-alone SMT solver or as 
  library in a backend. For a documentation of Boolector and its public 
  interface see 'doc/html/index.html'.

  A compiled version of the standalone solver is in the directory 'bin'.
  It is a dynamically linked 32-bit binary for x86 Linux.
 
  The directory 'include' contains the header file of Boolector's 
  public interface. You can find the compiled library 
  in the directory 'lib'. Finally, you can find examples in 'examples'.

  The website of Boolector is http://fmv.jku.at/boolector.

  See the file 'LICENSE'.
