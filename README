 ******************************************************************************

  This is a release of Boolector which is an efficient SMT solver for
  the quantifier-free theory of bit-vectors in combination with
  the quantifier-free extensional theory of arrays.
  Boolector can either be used as stand-alone SMT solver or as 
  library in a backend.

  You can find the statically linked 32-bit x86 Linux binary
  of the stand-alone solver in the subdirectory 'bin'. 
 
  The header file of Boolector's public interface is located in the
  directory 'include'. For a documentation of Boolector and its public 
  interface see 'doc/index.html'. You can find the compiled library in the 
  directory 'lib'. Finally, you can find examples in the sudirectory 
  'examples'.
