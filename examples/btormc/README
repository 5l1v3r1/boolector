After compiling 'btormc' and 'btorsim' run './run-examples.sh' which
runs the model checker 'btormc' and the simulator 'btorsim' on
the examples in this directory.  This produces if possible witnesses
of the single bad state property in these files, both with the model
checker and the simulator, as well as traces, which are no witnesses.

  .btor           original BTOR model
  .witnessmc      valid witness trace generated by the model checker
  .witnesssim     valid witness trace generated by the simulator
  .nowitnessmc    valid witness trace generated by the model checker
  .nowitnesssim   valid witness trace generated by the simulator

You can check witnesses with

  btorsim -c       <model> <witness> # only check witness
  btorsim          <model> <witness> # print trace instantiating don't cares
  btorsim --states <model> <witness> # print extended trace with states
