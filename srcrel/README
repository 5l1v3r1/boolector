Boolector @VERSION@ 

@DATE@

Source code release of Boolector. 

Boolector is an efficient SMT solver for the quantifier-free theory of
bit-vectors in combination with the quantifier-free extensional theory of
arrays.

For compilation please obtain the latest source code of PicoSAT from
  
  http://fmv.jku.at/picosat

Then extract from the archive the PicoSAT sources in the same directory
in which you extracted the Boolector sources.  Rename or link the
PicoSAT source directory to 'picosat'.  Then compile PicoSAT.  For
version 935 of PicoSAT this works as follows:

  cd <directory-where-you-extracted-boolector-sources>
  wget http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/picosat-935.tar.gz
  tar xf picosat-935.tar.gz
  ln -s picosat-935 picosat
  cd picosat
  ./configure -O           # this will improve performance
  make

You may want to do the same with 'PrecoSAT', e.g. get the latest
PrecoSAT sources from

  http://fmv.jku.at/precosat

extract the sources in the same directory, rename the PrecoSAT directory
and compile.  For version 456 of PrecoSAT this works as follows:

  cd <directory-where-you-extracted-boolector-sources>
  wget http://fmv.jku.at/precosat/precosat-465-02807a3-100208.tar.gz
  tar xf precosat-465-02807a3-100208.tar.gz
  ln -s precosat-465-02807a3-100208 precosat
  cd precosat
  ./configure
  make

Note, that PicoSAT is required in any case, but PrecoSAT is optional, but
it can give you substantial performance improvement for plain BV formulas.

Then issue

  ./configure
  make

or
  
  ./configure -precosat
  make

if you want to use PrecoSAT.

This will produce the library 'libboolector.a' with its API
'boolector.h', the stand-alone SMT solver 'boolector', a
simple delta debugger 'deltabtor', and small tool 'synthebtor',
which can be used to synthesize AIGs in Aiger format from BV.

You find generators for mostly crafted benchmarks in the 'examples'
sub-directory.  There are also some examples for using the API,
which are described in the API documentation.  You can generate
documentation on the API with 'doxygen'.  Run

  doxygen

in the top level source directory.  Then point your browser at

  firefox doc/html/index.html
